# Praticum Code-Bridge

This is an optional project created by Jeremy Rivera and Ilia Komissarov for Practicum. It was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. No brief was used but flexibility was encouraged.

## Bridging the Gap

This project was designed to give practical experience to us Students here at Practicum. Ilia is a Data Scientist student working on the final sprint in his program. Jeremy is a student of Software Development working on sprint 6 in the SE program. This project was created to 'bridge' the disciplines and challenge the students to work with someone outside of their specific fields, mimicking a real world situation.
